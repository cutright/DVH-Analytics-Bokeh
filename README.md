DICOM to SQL DVH Database

This code is intended for Radiation Oncology departments to build a SQL database of DVH's and various planning parameters from DICOM files (Plan, Structure, Dose).
This is a work in progress.

## Code organization
*DICOM_to_Python*  
This code contains functions that read dicom files and generate python objects containing the data required for input into the
SQL database.  There is no explicit user input.  All data is pulled from DICOM files (except for Rx's and Tx site from Pinnacle).

*SQL_Tools*  
This code handles all communication with SQL using MySQL Connector.  No DICOM files are used in this code and require the python objects
generated by DICOM_to_Python functions.

*DICOM_to_SQL*  
This has the simple objective of writing to SQL Database with only a starting path folder containing DICOM files.

*Analysis_Tools*  
These functions are designed to process data retrieved from the SQL database and convert into python objects.

*ROI_Name_Manager*  
From independently created .roi files, this class generates a map of roi names and provides functions to query
and edit this map.  Each roi points to an institutional roi, physician roi, and a physician.  

*SQL*  
See "Notes - SQL DB Structure.txt" for database structure.

## To Do List
- [ ] Validate dicompyler-core DVH calculations

- [ ] Write DICOM pre-import validation function

- [ ] Add thorough comments throughout all code

- [x] EUD calculations: Incorporate look-up tables of a-values
    - [ ] Validate calculations

- [ ] Incorporate BED calculations

- [ ] Validate functions in Analysis_Tools

- [ ] Develop for SQL other than MySQL
