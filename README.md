DICOM to SQL DVH Database

This code is intended for Radiation Oncology departments to build a SQL database of DVH's from DICOM files (Plan, Structure, Dose).
This is a work in progress.  This file will eventually contain instructions for an end-user.


### SQL Database format for this project
This code is being built assuming the database is MySQL.  There will be a master table called 'Plans' and 'DVHs'
in the database 'DVH'.  The 'Plans' table contains the following data:

Field | Type | Source
----- | ---- | ------
MRN | varchar(12) | RT_Plan.PatientID
PlanID | tinyint(4) unsigned | SQL Query
Birthdate | date | RT_Plan.PatientBirthDate
Age | tinyint(3) unsigned | RT_Plan.PatientBirthdate & RT_Plan.StudyDate
Sex | char(1) | RT_Plan.PatientSex
SimStudyDate | date | RT_Plan.StudyDate
RadOnc | varchar(50) | RT_Plan.ReferringPhysicianName
TxSite | varchar(50) | RT_Plan.RTPlanLabel (i.e., Plan name)
RxDose | float | User input point dose or max dose from dicompylercore
Fractions | tinyint(3) unsigned | Sum of RT_Plan.FractionGroupSequence[].NumberOfFractionsPlanned
StudyInstanceUID | varchar(100) | RT_Plan.StudyInstanceUID
PatientOrientation | varchar(3) | RT_Plan.PatientSetupSequence[0].PatientPosition (e.g., HFS, FFP, etc.)
PlanTimeStamp | datetime | RT_Plan.RTPlanDate and RT_Plan.RTPlanTime
StTimeStamp | datetime | RT_St.StructureSetDate and RT_St.StructureSetTime
DoseTimeStamp | datetime | RT_Dose.ContentDate and RT_Dose.ContentTime
TPSManufacturer | varchar(50) | RT_Plan.Manufacturer
TPSSoftwareName | varchar(50) | RT_Plan.ManufactuerModelName
TPSSoftwareVersion | varchar(30) | RT_Plan.SoftwareVersions
TxModality | varchar(30) | dicompyler GetPlan(), RT_Plan.BeamSequence[0].ControlPointSequence[0], RT_Plan.ManufactuerModelName
MUs | int(6) unsigned | Sum of RT_Plan.FractionGroupSequence[FxGroup].ReferencedBeamSequence[BeamNum].BeamMeterset (linac only)
TxTime | time | TBD (Brachy and Gamma Knife only)

PlanID is based on the plans in the database currently associated with the MRN (e.g., no other plans with PatientUID then PlanID = 0001).  
PlanUID is  MRN + PlanID (e.g., MRN = 000111222333, PlanID = 0005, then PlanUID = 0001112223330005.

DICOM files do not explicitly contain prescriptions or treatment sites.  This code requires that the plan name be equal to the Tx Site.
The prescription is parsed from a point stored in the DICOM RT Structure file with a name called 'rx: ' + [total dose] + 'Gy'. 
This point will have to be added by the user in their planning system prior to DICOM export.  If this point is not found, the code will
assume the Rx Dose is equal to the max point dose.


The 'DVHs' table has one row per ROI and follows this format:

Field | Type
----- | ----
MRN | varchar(12)
PlanID | tinyint(4) unsigned
ROIName | varchar(50) 
Type | varchar(20) 
Volume | double      
MinDose | double      
MeanDose | double      
MaxDose | double      
DoseBinSize | float       
VolumeString | mediumtext


All doses are in Gy. All volumes are in cm^3. All data is populated from a combination of DICOM RT strucutre and dose files using
dicompyler code.  VolumeString is a comma separated value string, when parsed generates a vector for the DVH y-values.  The x-values 
are to be generated as a vector of equal length to the y-axis with equally spaced values based on the DoseBinSize (e.g., 
VolumeString = '100,100,90,50,20,0' and DoseBinSize = 1.0 then x-axis vector would equal [0.5 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5]).

### Code organization
*DICOM_to_Python*  
This code contains functions that read dicom files and generate python objects containing the data required for input into the
SQL database.  There is no explicit user input.  All data is pulled from DICOM files.  The few values that DICOM files to not explicitly
record are entered in the Plan Name assuming the format '[Tx Site] [fractions] x [Dose]Gy.

*SQL_Tools*  
This code handles all communication with SQL with MySQL Connector.  No DICOM files are used in this code and require the python objects
generated by DICOM_to_Python functions.

*DICOM_to_SQL*  
This has the simple objective of writing to SQL Database with only the DICOM file paths as the input.
Currently this code is the least developed as it depends heavily on the previous two codes.

### To Do List
* Write SQL_Tools fuctions to
  * remove a plan row from PatientPlans master table

* Write DICOM pre-import validation function
  * Ensure proper data is populated in DICOM files prior to import
  * Input will be a folder, function will find file path for all needed DICOM files

* Adjust Connect_to_SQL() from SQL_Tools to read a config file for SQL server login information

* Convert this to do list into a markdown task list
